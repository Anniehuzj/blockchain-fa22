## Summary
The dApps in this folder should be explored and understood before interacting with the other examples.

## Examples
1. [Starter dApp Annotated](starter-dapp-annotated/index.html): a self-contained tutorial that contains thorough comments explaining nearly all lines of code included in the dApp. The dApp allows you to increase a number stored in a smart contract.
2. [Starter dApp](starter-dapp/index.html): the same dApp as above, without all the comments.
3. [Starer dApp Simple](starter-dapp-simple/index.html): basically the same dApp as above, but without the comments and the UI enhancements. The bare-minimum to have a functioning dApp.
