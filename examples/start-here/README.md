## Summary
The dApps in this folder should be explored and understood before interacting with the other examples. Other examples in this repository use similar code patterns to these, but with fewer explanatory comments.

Note, all 3 of these examples use the same contract. View the contract on Etherscan here: [https://goerli.etherscan.io/address/0x6c6Ea96A087D9E6CFfe8718c2c3377c53eDBaDA6](https://goerli.etherscan.io/address/0x6c6Ea96A087D9E6CFfe8718c2c3377c53eDBaDA6.).

## Examples
1. [Starter dApp Annotated](starter-dapp-annotated/index.html): a self-contained tutorial that contains thorough comments explaining nearly all lines of code included in the dApp. The dApp allows you to increase a number stored in a smart contract.
2. [Starter dApp](starter-dapp/index.html): the same dApp as above, without all the comments.
3. [Starer dApp Simple](starter-dapp-simple/index.html): basically the same dApp as above, but without the comments and the UI enhancements. The bare-minimum to have a functioning dApp.
