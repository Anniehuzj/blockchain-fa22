# Starter dApp Annotated

## Description
This version of the Starter dApp is heavily commented in order to clarify how the code works. However, the heavy commenting can, ironically, make the code itself harder to read. Other examples in this repo go much lighter on the comments, and assume you understand the basic functionality included in this starter dApp example.
